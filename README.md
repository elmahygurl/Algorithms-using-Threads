# Algorithms-using-Threads
## Project Overview
Implementing *Merge Sort* and *Matrix Multiplication* using POSIX Thread.


Two Matrix Multiplication Approaches:
1. The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread.
2.  The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.
